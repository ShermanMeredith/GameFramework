  characterStory: "Vincent is a born merchant. Therefore, he loves the Longest Road,
    while knights seem kind of suspicious \\nto him. \\n\\nHe is game for all sorts
    of trades. He is said to have sold \\nhis grandmother for a sheep, but that\u2019s
    sheer rumor. His greatest dream is to become a trade master one day. \\n\\nHis
    greatest nightmare are monopolists, which he refers \\nto with the phrase, \u201CMonopolists
    are worse than robbers, which at least don\u2019t take away more than they can
    carry at one go.\u201D"
