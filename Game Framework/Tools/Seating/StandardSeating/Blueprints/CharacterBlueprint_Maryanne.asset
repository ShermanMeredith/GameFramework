  characterName: Mary Anne
  characterStory: "Mary Anne has a big farm and a big heart. \\n\\nPeople who send
    the robber to her farm only temporarily fall from grace with her. It won\u2019t
    take long until she offers a cup of her delicious apple cider again. \\n\\nIt\u2019s
    easy to imagine her controlling an extended family of twenty people comprising
    four generations, always staying calm and kind. \\n\\nShe loves to build the Longest
    Road, because she wants to make sure that her farm always gets enough resources
    and commodities from Catan. Mary Anne is not that often among the winners of the
    Catan Board Game, but she \\nis always up for a game."
