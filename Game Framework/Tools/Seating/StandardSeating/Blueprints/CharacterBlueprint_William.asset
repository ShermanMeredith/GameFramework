  characterName: William
  characterStory: "Magistrate William is a scholar and author of the famous treatise
    \u201CThe World as a Strategy Game.\u201D \\n\\nHe spares no effort for his university
    and his studies - occasionally, he may stand up to the waist in the mud to dig
    for treasures somewhere on Catan. \\n\\nHe likes to lecture his opponents, and
    he analyzes their behavior based on scientific laws. \\n\\nIf William takes something
    from an opponent, he is only complying with the laws of nature; however, if an
    opponent takes something from him, it seems to \\nbe completely against nature."
