  characterName: Jean
  characterStory: "Jean is a pretty pirate woman with an honor code characteristic
    to her guild. \\n\\n\u201CRobbed is not stolen\u201D is her motto when she uses
    the robber to take other people\u2019s resources. But for the same reason, she
    isn\u2019t too resentful if she gets robbed herself. \\n\\nShe detests Trade Masters,
    Spies, and Monopolies, because she considers them simply as dishonorable and insidious
    robberies. \\n\\nNegotiations and compromises are not Jean\u2019s cup of tea.
    She says things straightforwardly, and if she finds someone likeable, it may happen
    that she kills \\na bottle of rum with him."
