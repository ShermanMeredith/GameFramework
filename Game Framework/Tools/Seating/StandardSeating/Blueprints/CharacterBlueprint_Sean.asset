  characterName: Sean
  characterStory: "Sean is more of an arrogant knight. He haughtily alleges to be
    far superior to everybody else, by virtue of his ancestors\u2019 achievements
    and the fact that he even knows the names of these people.  If he trades with
    someone, it means that he is granting that person a favor. If he places the robber
    next to someone, he is only collecting the tributes he is rightfully entitled
    to. This is something he often comments on with the phrase: \u201CYou are nothing
    but my vassal on this island; therefore, part of your harvest is mine anyway.\u201D
    \ If his resource income allows it, Sean will always try to get the Largest Army.
    But, and this counts in his favor, he also can lose with honor and acknowledge
    the success of his game partners.  For his German friends, Sean goes under the
    name of Siegfried."
