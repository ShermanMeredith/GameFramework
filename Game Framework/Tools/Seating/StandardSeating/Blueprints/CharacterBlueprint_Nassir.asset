  characterName: Nassir
  characterStory: "Nassir is a shrewd Catanian master merchant who \\nalways knows
    exactly what he\u2019s after. His merchant caravans reach even the most remote
    places \u2013 provided, of course, that rich profits can be made there. \\n\\nHis
    commercial skills are second to none. To minimize the entrepreneurial risk, he
    maintains a substantial mercenary force, which he uses not only to protect his
    goods transports from attacks but also to convince reluctant trading partners
    of the fairness of his trade offers. \\n\\nIn this context, one of his favorite
    lines is, \u201CTrust me -  I know what\u2019s best for you.\u201D"
