  characterName: Hildegard
  characterStory: "One of the greatest wishes of Hildegard is to be venerated as a
    saint. Malicious gossip has it that she already made good progress by being sanctimonious.
    \ Hildegard has no problem combining unctuous talk with furthering her personal
    welfare, and she often uses profundities, be they adequate or not. When she takes
    something away from an opponent, she likes to accompany this act with the comment:
    \u201CPlease do not regard this as robbery! Regard it as a relief, granted to
    you so you can give alms to the needy.\u201D  However, if someone takes something
    from her, she might wish him to turn into a stone."
