  characterName: Lin
  characterStory: "Lin is a seasoned expert in the transfer of ownership.\\nFor this,
    she mostly relies on the surprise effect when she and her band of outlaws suddenly
    appear out of nowhere and relieve well-heeled travelers of all their valuables.\\n\\nAlthough
    they simply call her a robber\u2019s bride, Lin insists that she is nobody\u2019s
    bride, and much less that of a robber!\\n\\nShe denies any similarity to robbers,
    seeing herself as an enforcer of poetic justice; someone who redistributes wealth,
    often giving generous gifts to the needy.\\n\\nShe deeply loathes robbers who
    want all the stolen goods only for themselves, and she sends them to the desert
    whenever she can."
