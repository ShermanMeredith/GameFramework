  characterStory: "Thorolf is a master woodcutter and carpenter and a \\ndown-to-earth
    character. \\n\\nSecuring his resource income comes first for him.  \\n\\nHis
    favorite saying, \u201CThe best diplomats are a sharp axe and a keen sword,\u201D
    testifies to his rather harsh tone. \\n\\nHowever, this should not belie the fact
    that his heart is in the right place."
